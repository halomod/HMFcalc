# HMFcalc

** An online application for calculating Halo Mass Functions **

This is the source code for the HMFcalc web-app, hosted at http://hmf.icrar.org.

If you are looking for the Python library to calculate HMFs,
see https://github.com/steven-murray/hmf

This website is powered by Django and uses Bootstrap 4 as a CSS framework.

To acknowledge use of this app, cite
[Murray, Power & Robotham (2013)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26C.....3...23M").

## Why this repo
Why provide this open-source repo for the web-app instead of just providing the
app itself?

* Gives insight into the workings of the app
* Lets users [create issues](https://github.com/steven-murray/HMFcalc/issues/new)
  to file bugs and make suggestions.
* You could even possible fire up your own development server and run HMFcalc
  on your machine.
