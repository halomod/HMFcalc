README

For more extensive notes on this implementation and the HMF in general, see the paper (reference here soon).

This package is a django web-app, implementing the calculation of the halo mass function in as general a way as 
possible while keeping it easy to use. 

This app is not provided as a re-usable app, but rather as an insight into the workings of the current implementation
at hmf.icrar.org. Feel free to modify it and let me know any bugs.
