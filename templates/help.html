            This page outlines the common usage of HMF<em>calc</em>, along with
            information concerning the various parameters and options included.
            Much of this information is a modified rendition of
            <a href=http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6721>this article</a>, which
            accompanied the publishing of HMF<em>calc</em>, though the backend
            has changed significantly since this publication.
            Read on for information about common usage, the transfer function
            used, the cosmological parameters and the fitting functions.
        </p>

        <h3>Using HMF<em>calc</em></h3>
        <p>
            HMF<em>calc</em> is built to be easy to use. In the simplest example,
            the only action required on your part is to navigate to the
            <a href="/hmfcalc/">calculator</a> and click "Calculate".
            All required options and parameters are filled with
            sensible defaults and ready to go. Nevertheless, most users will
            want to fiddle with the parameters to tune them to their
            particular needs -- be it a survey, simulation or investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The options and parameters in HMF<em>calc</em> were chosen to give
            as much flexibility as possible without making things overly
            complicated. They are split over tabs in the calculator, each
            governing a different sub-model.
        </p>

        <p>
            The organisation of these tabs is no accident -- it mirrors the
            internal organisation of the <code>hmf</code> code.
            <code>hmf</code> is composed of a series of <code>components</code>,
            integrated into <code>frameworks</code>. Each <code>component</code>
            and <code>framework</code> receives its own Tab in HMF<em>calc</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In particular, <code>components</code> often have many different
            <span class="font-italic">models</span> which can be chosen for them.
            One obvious example is the hmf model itself (i.e. the fitting function
            chosen to model f(&#963)). Each of these models (for the same
            <code>component</code>) may have different parameters. These parameters
            will be shown dynamically as you chose the relevant models.
        </p>

        <h4>Model Creation and Editing</h4>
        <p>
            New to HMF<em>calc</em> is the ability to view and edit the models
            that have been thus-far created. Each created model receives its
            own entry in a table below the main plotting interface. From there,
            you can choose to edit or delete the model. Also, you can create a
            new model based on the existing model (all parameter defaults for
            the new model will match the parameters of the model that was
            chosen as a starting point).
        </p>
        <p>
            HMF<em>calc</em> starts with a default model (matching the default
            model of <code>hmf</code>) and allows you to edit or create more
            models based on this default. You can delete all but one model,
            as HMF<em>calc</em> always expects to have at least one model
            defined.
        </p>
        <p>
            Models are persistent -- you can navigate to this help page and
            back to the <a href="/hmfcalc/">calculator</a> and your models
            will remain. To restart calculations from the original default
            model and delete all the models you've created in the session,
            use the big red restart button in the calculator.
        </p>

        <!--

        <h3>Transfer Function</h3>

        The transfer function is handled in one of three ways. It is either
    <ol>
        <li> Previously computed at high resolution by <a href="http://camb.info">CAMB</a> and included as a default
            option.
        </li>
        <li> Previously computed <em>by the user</em> either with CAMB or saved in the same format as CAMB, and uploaded
            to HMF<em>calc</em></li>
        <li> Computed on-the-fly with arbitrary cosmological parameters.
    </ol>
    We describe some of the details of each method in this section.

    <h5>Pre-Computed High-Res Transfer</h5>
    <p>This is the default option. It is selected by choosing a popular cosmology from the "Transfer Function" drop-down
        list.
        Parameters of that cosmology that affect that transfer function in any way
        are internally set and made non-modifiable so that no confusion arises. Parameters that are relevant to the
        cosmology and prescribed in
        the relevant paper, but which do not affect the transfer function, are set by default to their proper values but
        are still modifiable.
    </p>
    <p>
        This option does not allow the automatic generation of HMF's for several cosmologies, except for in the
        transfer-independent parameters,
        as only one default may be chosen at a time. However, you may use the "Add Extra Plots" feature after generating
        a HMF to add different
        default cosmologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        As mentioned, each of the default cosmologies is a high-resolution transfer function from CAMB. In each case,
        all parameters of the run
        (and there are many) were the same, except for the cosmological parameters. The following table shows the values
        for each of the cosmologies, where
        each set of parameters was taken from a corresponding paper, linked from the heading. Note that the
        n<sub>s</sub> and &#963<sub>8</sub> are not used
        to calculate the transfer function within CAMB, but we list their values here for completeness.

    <h5>User-Uploaded Transfer</h5>
    <p>
        To select this option, choose "Custom Transfer" from the "Transfer Function" drop-down list and then upload a
        file using the "Upload Transfer Function"
        tool. The user must be careful using this option. There is no way for HMF<em>calc</em> to know what cosmology
        the uploaded transfer function was
        calculated with. The user must therefore be careful to set the correct corresponding parameters. Note that only
        parameters that affect both transfer
        and the mass function explicitly (see cosmological parameter table) need to be set accurately. Parameters
        affecting only the transfer function will not
        be used within HMF<em>calc</em>, and parameters used only in HMF<em>calc</em> will not be at odds with the
        transfer function. However, for later reference
        it is still better to set every parameter properly, as the parameters are written to file which may later be
        read.

        The file uploaded in this manner should be in the same format as a transfer function produced by CAMB. That is,
        it should consist of one column of <em>k/h</em>
        values, followed by 6 columns of transfer function values. The last column should be the total transfer
        function.
    </p>

    <h5>On-The-Fly Transfer</h5>
    <p>This option is selected if a custom transfer function is chosen, but
        no file is uploaded. In this case the user may choose a calculator to use.
        Currently only two options are available - CAMB and the Eisenstein-Hu transfer function (which is
        calculated using the cosmolopy package).
    </p>
    <p>
        If CAMB is chosen as the calculator, HMF<em>calc</em> only offers the cosmological parameters
        as input parameters to CAMB. All other parameters are taken as the defaults from the backend hmf package (listed
        in the camb parameters table).
        This is both to save computation time (the defaults are the most efficient to achieve requisite accuracy at high
        mass, see the linked article),
        and to avoid unnecessary clutter in the options.
    </p>

    <h3>Parameters</h3>
    <p>
        We have discussed already that the options and parameters of HMF<em>calc</em> are split across two categories:
        run parameters and cosmological parameters.
    </p>

    <p>
        We first have the run parameters. In this table, the "Mult?" column specifies whether the given parameter
        accepts multiple entries (separated by commas).
        <img src="http://hmfstatic.appspot.com/img/runparams.png">
    </p>
    <p>
        Secondly we have the cosmological parameters. The "Affects" column specifies whether the parameter affects the
        transfer function (T), the HMF (H) or both (B).

    <h3>Fitting Functions</h3>
    <p>
        One of the features of HMF<em>calc</em> is its wide array of fitting functions from the literature. We aim to
        include any fit from the published literature
        that we find, and encourage you to contact us if you know of a fit which we have not included.
    </p>
    <p>
        With such a list of available fits, it is perhaps useful to provide some short commentary on how to best choose
        among them for a specific purpose. We note
        that each fitting function is a fit to the distribution of halo masses found in a simulation (or set of
        simulations) with a particular cosmology, and using
        a particular halo-finder. Thus differences between fits can naturally arise from these choices, along with the
        evolution of resolution and size with time.
        Given these considerations, we give a few suggestions for choosing a fitting function:
    <ul>
        <li>Prefer functions measured at a similar cosmology to the one you employ</li>
        <li>Generally choose a later function over an earlier one</li>
        <li>If you are using a wide range of cosmologies, or want to remain as general as possible, prefer a function
            fitted over several cosmologies
        </li>
        <li>Generally, for observational purposes, choose an SO fit, but for halo-model calculations choose an FOF
            fit.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        To help weigh these considerations, we here provide the list of references for all fitting functions found in
