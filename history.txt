		Urgent bugfix
		dlnsdlnM called too early.
		CAMB-made transfer function file deleted too early.
		
0.9.7 - 18 March 2013

        Made calculation of dlnsdlnM in init since it is same for all z

0.9.6 - 12 March 2013
		Updated ngtm/Mgtm to be their own methods
		Added nltm/Mltm to Perturbations()

		Now makes use of pandas instead of those accursed numpy recarrays
		This makes adding new methods and functions extremely simple.

		Added a "start again" link to plots page
		Made the extra plots (N>M etc) have their own form section.
		Updated PlotChoices() in forms.py so all extra plots can be viewed when appropriate

        First version number. 
		The site works, and has had a bit of work up to this point.
		HMF is calculated correctly.
		Also other functions akin to the HMF.
